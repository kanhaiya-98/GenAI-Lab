# Local LLM Q\&A Chatbot

A simple yet powerful Q\&A chatbot that runs entirely on your local machine using **Streamlit** and **Ollama**. This project enables you to interact with open-source language models such as **Llama 3**, **Phi-3**, and **Mistral** without requiring internet access or paid API services.

The application features a modern user interface with chat history, model selection, and parameter tuning for a seamless and customizable experience.

## Features

* **Interactive Chat Interface**: A clean and modern UI for smooth conversational interaction.
* **Chat History**: Maintains session-based conversation history.
* **Local LLM Support**: Powered by Ollama, allowing use of models like Llama 3, Phi-3, and others locally.
* **Model Configuration**: Switch easily between different models available on your system via a dropdown menu.
* **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust temperature and maximum response length in real-time to control creativity and verbosity.
* **Secure & Private**: Models run entirely on your machine; no data is sent to external servers.
* **Built with Modern Tools**: Uses Streamlit for the frontend and LangChain for LLM orchestration.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

**Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables (Optional)

If you want to enable LangSmith for tracking and debugging LLM calls:

1. Sign up at [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith).
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root.
3. Add the following:

```bash
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your_langsmith_api_key_here"
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
```

If you choose not to use LangSmith, the application will still function normally.

---

## Running the Application

With your virtual environment activated and dependencies installed, run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

By default, the application will be available at:
[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

You can now interact with your local LLM through the chatbot interface.

Would you like me to also create a **section for “Future Improvements” and “Contributing”** so your README looks startup-grade and attractive to recruiters?
